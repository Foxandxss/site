Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly. Combined with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands.
</p>

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* shows you how to build a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) application based on these technologies. During the process you will learn to:

0. Set up a webpack based development and production environment. You will learn to get most out of [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for development.
0. Improve the quality of your code by using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and friends to spot possible mistakes earlier.
0. Get into the React mindset while learning the basics of [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), an implementation of [Flux Application Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).
0. Style your React application in various emerging ways.
0. Implement drag and drop for your application using [React DnD](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/).

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript but beyond that not much is needed. You just need to have patience to work through the book and poke me in case there's something you don't understand!
