# SurviveJS - Site

This is the source of [survivejs.com](survivejs.com).

## Development

First, you need to clone this repository and the `webpack_react` one:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/survivejs/site
$ git clone https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react
```

Then, you need to build each `webpack_react` project (it is a needed requisite to build this site):

```
$ cd webpack_react/project_source
$ ./build_all.js
```

Now going back to the `site` project, you need to install the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g antwar-cli
```

**NOTE**: There's some glitch in Antwar preventing it to work locally so it has to go this way.

Finally, you can start the development server:

```
$ npm start
```

Now you can go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment

After you modify `antwar.config.js` to configure your deploy settings, you need to generate a static build:

```
$ npm run build
```

And after you checked out the build, you can deploy it with:

```
$ npm run deploy
```
